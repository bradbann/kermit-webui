This is a WebUI server for MCollective management

It is written in with Django 1.3 and Python 2.6 (but it works without problem with Python 2.4 too).

To start the application, for development, you just need to type:

python src/automatix/manage.py runserver

and then access to the application using:

http://localhost:8000

CONFIGURATION:
In this file 'src/automatix/settings.py' we have configured the access to the Ruby Mcollective RestServer, by default on the same machine of this project

RUBY_REST_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4567/mcollective/"

If you have a different configuration you can just change this property with your preferred address.
